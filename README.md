I was focused on understanding document.querySelectorAll, which somehow turned into trying to learn about APIs. This was my first time trying to even grasp the idea of using APIs and JSON and for the first day it wasn’t so bad at all. Felt good learning the very beginning of a new skill!


Also.. This wasn’t meant to be anything special, this has zero styling to the HTML. This isn’t dummy proof; this is for pure motivation to get better and to see how far I have come from console.log(‘Hello World’)
